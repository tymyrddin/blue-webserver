## Mind

The old shaman said carefully, "You didn't just see two men go through upside down on a broomstick, shouting and screaming at each other, did you?" The boy looked at him levelly. "Certainly not," he said. The old man heaved a sigh of relief. "Thank goodness for that," he said. "Neither did I." ~ Rincewind and Twoflower take up broomstick flying (Terry Pratchett, The Light Fantastic)
