## What?

To protect web applications against the most obvious information disclosure issues, make sure that the web server does not send out response headers or background information that reveal technical details about the backend technology type, version or setup.

## Why?

Make it harder for attackers to [fingerprint your tech stack](https://recon.tymyrddin.dev/docs/app/techstack).
